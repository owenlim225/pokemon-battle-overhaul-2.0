# Pokemon Battle Game


Welcome to the **Pokemon Battle Game**, an interactive command-line game where players select, battle, and manage Pokemon to compete in thrilling battles! This project consists of three main components: `backend.py`, `frontend.py`, and `main.py`. Each module contributes to creating a seamless gameplay experience, handling player selection, battle logic, and console-based UI using the `rich` library.

python main.py
```

## Project Structure

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py          # Entry point of the game
â”œâ”€â”€ backend.py       # Backend logic including player data and battle handling
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend.py      # Console interface using rich library
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
```

## Gameplay Flow
- `Player Pokemon Selection`: Players choose their Pokemon from a list.

- `Battle Preparation`: Players are prompted to select Pokemon for each battle.

- `Battle Execution`: The game processes battle results, applies fatigue, and health changes.

- `Potion/Poison Even`t`: Players may receive blessings, with a chance of being transformed into potions or poisons.

- `End Game`: A summary of all battles is displayed at the end.
